# ComplianceMailPurge
this is a mailpurger. it purges mail.

A basic interface for doing basic e-mail security remediation in Exchange Online. For cloud-only Exchange admins looking for a way to make sense of Purview/Compliance & Security actions in powershell, without learning enough that their heads hurt. Created because a "Name", an "Identity", and a "SearchName" are all actually the same thing, but Microsoft disagrees.

# Requirements

1. Powershell (ideally updated to at least version 5)
2. An account with Exchange Admin and Secuirty & Compliance Roles
